Hey there! We're [Tampa Devs](https://www.tampa.devs.com?utm_source=td_talent&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=web). We're building Tampa Devs Talent to make it easier for developers in and around Tampa Bay to find their next gig, while supporting the amazing educational, community, and career resources that our nonprofit provides.

Tampa Devs Talent is being built around three core values:

1. Empowering developers and companies to find great local opportunities
1. Supporting and growing Tampa Bay's tech community
1. Building a high-quality, safe, and inclusive environment for everyone
